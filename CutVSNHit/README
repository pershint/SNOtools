Usage: ./CutVSNHit [outputfilename.root] [list of files to check for DC]
Example: ./CutVSNHit thegoods.root /path/to/files/*.ntuple.root


This program will output a root file with several histograms detailing the
Number of events that were flagged vs. nhit in the input root files.

Note that right now, the check is only made on events that have the isCal bool
as true.  For regular golden runs, remove this part of the check.

#######NOTE######
Before usage, you will need to modify the variable cut_mask in CutVSNHit.cc.
This is the mask that will be checked against for whether an event is "dirty"
or "clean".

If you want to produce outputs for several different masks, I would suggest
Adding a vector object at code start that contains all of the cuts you are interested in.  
Nest the current code in a for loop that will run everything for each cut mask
in your vector.  You would have to make sure you append the cut mask integer to
 the output root name, or add it as an entry to the output root file,
so you know which file is associated with each cut.
