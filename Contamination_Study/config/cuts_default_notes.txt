Description of different cut configuration toggles

###----------PATHOLOGICAL CUTS FOR SACRIFICE/CONTAMINATION-----------###
Events that are considered pathological are not included in either the
               sacrifice or contamination studies.

sacpath_DCmask: pathological cuts applied before estimating sacrifice
(For full N16 sacrifice analysis, you'll want this to be set to zero.  For the
bifurcation analysis sacrifice, apply the same path as bifurpath_DCmask)

bifurpath_DCmask: pathological cuts used in making bifurcation boxes.  If
an event has any of these flags, it will not be put into the a,b,c,d boxes.

path_trigmask: default is esumhi, esumlo, ped, pgt
#NOTE: Pathological cuts are NOT applied to Monte Carlo datasets!  So the
#Number of nonpathological events is the number passing energy/position cuts

###---------CUTS AND TOGGLES FOR SACRIFICE & BIFURCATION PROCESS-----------------###
cut1_DCmask: Use rat-tools/DataCleaningTools/dcflags.py to make your mask.
cut1_trigmask: default is just OWLEH
Events failing either of the above only go into the b box

cut2_b14, cut2_itr defaults: -0.12 < b14 < 0.95, itr<0.55
Events failing b14 and/or itr (while DC is clean) go into the c box.

Events failing both of the above cut sets will go into the d box.
