Description of different cut configuration toggles

The Contamination_Study analysis code can serve two purposes:
  - Estimating the data cleaning sacrifice using calibration data
  - Conducting an instrumental contamination study using a bifurcated analysis

Depending on your ultimate end-game, your config file will want to be configured
differently.  Here is a guide for helping with this process/building your own
config file.

###----------PATHOLOGICAL CUTS FOR SACRIFICE/CONTAMINATION-----------###
Events that are considered pathological are not included in either the
               sacrifice or contamination studies.
fitValid: if true, only events with a valid reconstruction will be used
to estimate the sacrifice with calibration data/instrumental contamination with
analysis data.  If false, events with AND without fitValid will be considered.


isCal: if true, only events with the FECD PMT hit in the calibration data
will be used to estimate the sacrifice with calibration data. 
(You want this to be true if you're using N16 calibration data)

AVudotrCut: if true, implements the AV cut used to select events from
the AV ROI.  Specific function should be specified in waterdoc, but is:
(udotr > (1.0 - 12 *((posr3-%f)**2)))"%(posr3_AVcut)


E_high, E_low: Defines the energy range for events considered for sacrifice
analysis
nhits_high, nhits_low: Defines the nhit range for events consiered for
sacrifice/contamination analyses
Z_high,Z_low: Defines the z-range, in centimeters, for events considered for
sacrifice/contamination studies
r_high, r_low: Defines the radius, in millimeters, for events considered for
sacrifice/contamination studies
udotr_high, udotr_low: Defines the u.r value range for events considered for
the sacrifice/contamination studies

sacpath_DCmask: pathological cuts applied before estimating sacrifice using
calibration data. Any
event with one of the flags in this mask will not be used in the sacrifice/
contamination studies.

(Relevant for contamination study only. For most standalone DC sacrifice analyses,
 you'll want sacpath_DCmask to be set to zero.)


bifurpath_DCmask: pathological cuts used in making bifurcation boxes with
analysis data.  If an event has any of these flags, it will not be put
 into the a,b,c,d boxes.

(Relevant for contamination study only. For most standalone DC sacrifice analyses,
 you'll want bifurpath_DCmask to be set to zero.)

(If estimating the sacrifice for use in the contamination study,
you'll want this mask to be the sacpath and bifurpath to be the same DCmask
unless you know why you want them to be different.)

path_trigmask: Any events with a flag from this trigger mask
 will not be considered/used for the sacrifice/contamination studies
(ND contamination analysis default is esumhi, esumlo, ped, pgt)
(When doing most DC sacrifice studies, you'll want this to be set to zero)

run_setup: This dictionary controls what variables the sacrifice is analyzed
across, the number of bins to use, and whether to analyze just the Data sacrifice
or Data/MC comparison for data cleaning.
Possible options for CUTS_TODO: "cut1", "cut2", "cut1_DataMCComp", "cut2_DataMCComp"
SACRIFICE_VARIABLES: Current ones implemented (i.e. variables that have bounds, and
are present after running the subtupler) are:
"energy","posr3","udotr","nhits","posz"


###---------CUTS AND TOGGLES FOR SACRIFICE & BIFURCATION PROCESS-----------------###

cut1_sacDCmask: Use rat-tools/DataCleaningTools/dcflags.py to make your mask (any 
events with a flag in the mask you make are considered "dirty" events). Then,
input that number into this entry; this mask will be applied when 
quantifying the DC sacrifice on your input sacrifice
analysis files (i.e. when using the --sacrifice flag).

cut1_bifurDCmask: Use rat-tools/DataCleaningTools/dcflags.py to make your mask.
this mask will be applied on the data that fills the bifurcation boxes on your analysis
data (i.e. files contained in the directory defined with --analysisdir)
Events that fail this cut alone will go into the b box.

WATER PHASE NOTE: The need for these two masks came from the Neckcut having an artificially
inflated sacrifice during the November 2017 scan.  Therefore, it is not used when
quanfiying the sacrifice (was found negligible in the May 2017 scan), but
 still plays a role in the bifurcation.

cut2_b14, cut2_itr defaults: -0.12 < b14 < 0.95, itr<0.55
These are the cuts used when either analyzing the classifier sacrifice directly,
or performing the data/MC comparison of the classifiers.  Additionally, for
the bifurcation analysis, these cuts indicate whether or not events fail the
classifier cut of the bifurcation analysis (i.e. go into the c box).

Events failing both of the above cut sets will go into the d box.
