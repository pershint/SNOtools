Description of different cut configuration toggles

The Contamination_Study analysis code can serve two purposes:
  - Estimating the data cleaning sacrifice using calibration data
  - Conducting an instrumental contamination study using a bifurcated analysis

Depending on your ultimate end-game, your config file will want to be configured
differently.  Here is a guide for helping with this process/building your own
config file.

###----------PATHOLOGICAL CUTS FOR SACRIFICE/CONTAMINATION-----------###
Events that are considered pathological are not included in either the
               sacrifice or contamination studies.
fitValid: if true, only events with a valid reconstruction will be used
to estimate the sacrifice with calibration data/instrumental contamination with
analysis data.

isCal: if true, only events with the FECD PMT hit in the calibration data
will be used to estimate the sacrifice with calibration data. 
(You want this to be true if you're using N16 calibration data)

E_high, E_low: Defines the energy range for events considered for sacrifice
analysis
nhits_high, nhits_low: Defines the nhit range for events consiered for
sacrifice/contamination analyses
Z_high,Z_low: Defines the z-range, in centimeters, for events considered for
sacrifice/contamination studies
r_high, r_low: Defines the radius, in millimeters, for events considered for
sacrifice/contamination studies
udotr_high, udotr_low: Defines the u.r value range for events considered for
the sacrifice/contamination studies

sacpath_DCmask: pathological cuts applied before estimating sacrifice using
calibration data. Any
event with one of the flags in this mask will not be used in the sacrifice/
contamination studies.

(Relevant for contamination study only. For the N16 DC sacrifice analysis,
 you'll want sacpath_DCmask to be set to zero.)


bifurpath_DCmask: pathological cuts used in making bifurcation boxes with
analysis data.  If an event has any of these flags, it will not be put
 into the a,b,c,d boxes.

(Relevant for contamination study only. For the N16 DC sacrifice analysis,
 you'll want bifurpath_DCmask to be set to zero.)

(If estimating the sacrifice for use in the contamination study,
you'll want this mask to be the sacpath and bifurpath to be the same DCmask
unless you know why you want them to be different.)

path_trigmask: Any events with a flag from this trigger mask
 will not be considered/used for the sacrifice/contamination studies
(ND contamination analysis default is esumhi, esumlo, ped, pgt)
(When doing DC sacrifice studies, you'll want this to be set to zero)

###---------CUTS AND TOGGLES FOR SACRIFICE & BIFURCATION PROCESS-----------------###
cut1_DCmask: Use rat-tools/DataCleaningTools/dcflags.py to make your mask.
cut1_trigmask: default is just OWLEH
Events failing either of the above only go into the b box

cut2_b14, cut2_itr defaults: -0.12 < b14 < 0.95, itr<0.55
Events failing b14 and/or itr (while DC is clean) go into the c box.

Events failing both of the above cut sets will go into the d box.
