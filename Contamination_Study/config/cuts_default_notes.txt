Description of different cut configuration toggles
sacpath_DCmask: pathological cuts used to estimate sacrifice
(this is different than bifurpath because missedmuonfollower is energy biased in N16)
bifurpath_DCmask: pathological cuts used in making bifurcation boxes
muon, tpmuonshort&long,junk,ringoffire,zerozero, itc
path_trigmask: esumhi, esumlo, ped, pgt
fits(dcs)_only: 0 for false, 1 for true
cut_DCmask: Use rat-tools/DataCleaningTools/dcflags.py to make your mask
cut_trigmask: default is just OWLEH
cut_b14, cut_itr defaults: -0.12 < b14 < 0.95, itr<0.55

dcs_only and fits_only usage:
if dcs_only & fits_only == 0, then branch 1 is specified by cut1_DCmask and cut1_trigmask and
branch 2 is specified by cut2_b14 and cut2_itr.
if dcs_only == 1, then branch 1 is specified by cut1_DCmask and cut1_trigmask and
branch 2 is specified by cut2_DCmask and cut2_trigmask.
if dcs_only == 2, then branch 1 is specified by cut1_b14 and cut1_itr and
branch 2 is specified by cut2_itr and cut2_itr.

NOTE: cut1_DCmask and cut1_trigmask are used for the DC part of the sacrifice
histograms.  cut2_b14 and cut2_itr are used for the Fit parameters that specify
the sacrifice histograms.
