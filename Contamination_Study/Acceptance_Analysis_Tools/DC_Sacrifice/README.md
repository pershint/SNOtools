DCSacrifice takes in an N16 calibration file and
returns a root file that contains histograms.
These histograms are the clean and dirty events in the
Event as a function of NHit.

The output here should be moved to ../N16_DCSacs

NOTE: There are preliminary cuts made before checking
for the final master bitmask defined.  These preliminary
cuts should be the same as what you find in the Bifurcated
Analysis program and the Beta14ITR_Sacrifice program.
